# Theme & Product List App

## What I Learned

* Used **useState** to manage both theme mode and a list of products.
* Implemented **increment and decrement functionality** for product quantities with event handlers.
* Applied **conditional rendering and styling** for dark/light theme switching.
* Updated **array and object state immutably** using map() and the spread operator
* Passed **state and handler functions as props** to reusable components (Navbar,Section,Table)
* Rendered **dynamic data** using map() to display product details.
* Styled the UI with **Bootstrap** for a clean, responsive layout
